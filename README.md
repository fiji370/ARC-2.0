# ARC-2.0
A fast, intelligent bot that completes your ELA homework.

ARC (Automatic Reading Comprehension) is a bot designed to manipulate and process text. It's quite simple actually. 
Firstly, the input file is filled with the source text upon which the ELA questions are based. Second, the user runs the program,
and inputs any question about the input text. The bot will then extract keywords, and find frequent words used alongside those keywords.
Meaningful sentences are found using pronoun to noun to length ratios. Answers are scored based on their frequency of keywords, as well
as their lack of frequent pronouns. A snippet from the text is then returned, answering the question.
